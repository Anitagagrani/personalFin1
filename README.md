# Personal Finance

Rather than paying for a budget planning and expense tracking program, I decided to create one for myself.

The tracking is a simple, yet manual process.  In an Excel spreadsheet, I document each expense and income source with:

 - Date
 - Category
 - Item
 - Amount
 
The scripts contained in this project will create summary tables and visualizations for the recorded expenses.
